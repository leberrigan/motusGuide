<h1>Motus Guidebook</h1>
<p>This guide was designed to help both researchers and public collaborators access data available on Motus.org. It will be split into four distinct sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<h3>1.1 Registering a new user</h3>
<p>Before you can create a new project or join an existing project, you must first create a user. This can be done by selecting <strong>Register</strong> at the top right of any page on the Motus website. You will also be given the option to register a user any time you try to access a page under ‘Manage Data’. <a href="https://motus.org/data/user/new">Click here to register a new user</a></p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>When creating a new user you will have the option to be a <strong>Collaborator</strong> or <strong>Principal Investigator</strong>. Any user requesting to be a <strong>Principal Investigator</strong> will require authentication by Motus staff. An email will automatically be sent to Motus staff upon registration for authentication.</p>

<h3>1.2 How data is organised</h3>
<div id="receivers" class="section level4">
<h4>1.2.1 Receivers</h4>
<p>We define receivers as the computers used to collect data. In order to keep track of different station setups or different locations where an individual computer is used, we organize them into deployments. For instance, if you have a computer at a station and you had the antennas at that station pointing in one direction for the first month and then you changed their direction, you would need to have at least two deployments to identify when those antenna directions are changed. You will need a new deployment for any of the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Antenna angle</li>
<li>Antenna height</li>
<li>Number of antennas</li>
<li>Antenna type</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Computer (receiver)</li>
</ul>
<p>Data will often be displayed by receiver serial number (e.g.: <em>Lotek-6325</em>, or; <em>SG-5541RPI3E7F8</em>) and the Deployment ID (4-digit number).</p>

<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>We provide a public interface for collaborators to explore data available in the Motus Network. This interface allows collaborators to view information about individual receivers, tags, and projects in the form of data summaries. To prevent your data from being publically accessible, you must set your project to private. See <a href="#ch311">Chapter 3.1.1</a> for information on how to change your project’s privacy settings.</p>
<p>There are several datasets publically available on the web interface and downloadable as a CSV file (comma-separated variable).</p>

<h3>2.1 Projects</h3>
<p>You can view a list of all projects registered to Motus by going to <em><a href="https://motus.org/data/projects">Explore Data &gt; Projects</a></em>. This same list can be downloaded as a CSV by going to <em><a href="https://motus.org/data/downloads">Explore Data &gt; Download Data</a></em> and selecting the appropriate option.</p>
<p>Each project has three links embedded within the table:</p>

<h3>2.3 Tags</h3>
<p>Tags are the radio transmitters that are affixed to animals for tracking. These tags emit a coded ‘burst’ of radio pulses that encode a unique ID for that tag. There are a limited number of unique IDs that can be produced, however, making it necessary to find other way to expand the number of uniquely identifyable tags. This is done by also calculating the length of time between each coded burst, called the <strong>burst interval</strong>. Only prime numbers are used as burst intervals to eliminate the possibility of one interval resembling another, which limits the number of unique tags to just over 36,000. However, tags with longer burst intervals are more difficult to track manually and are less likely to be detected during a fly-by, so most researchers opt for lower interval lengths. For this reason, Lotek has had to reproduce some tags to keep up with the demand. This makes it extremely important to ensure no two identical tags are deployed at the same time. This is another reason why it is essential that collaborators report when tags are being used.</p>
<p>You can explore tags by project or receiver. To view tags for a specific project, go to <em><a href="https://motus.org/data/projects">Explore Data &gt; Projects</a></em> and click on the <strong>Tags</strong> column for the project you wish to explore.</p>

Please note that these maps have been created using broad filters based on theoretical flight speeds, logical geographic/time sequences, and at least three consecutive tag detections at each station. Due to the nature of this dataset, these tracks are not to be taken as 100% true.</p>

<p>It is essential that collaborators maintain accurate and up-to-date metadata. Failure to do so may result in a number of issues that can go unnoticed for long periods of time. Your project’s metadata is not only important for yourself, but for every other project that may use your equipment. For instance, a receiver with inaccurate antenna directions may provide false information on departure direction. Another common mistake is to not supply tag deployment dates until a long time after deployment which may result in missed detections.</p>
<p>In order to prevent mistakes and misinformation, it is important to follow these steps to ensure all your metadata is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>Information will be organised as it appears on the Motus website.</p>

<div id="manage-tags" class="section level3">
<h3>3.4 Manage Tags</h3>
<p>It is important to register tags prior to deploying them since there can be issues with registration that prevent us from being able to sort out tag detections, but also because our tag finder algorithm needs a search pattern to look for when going through detection data.</p>
<p>Tag finder only searches for tags that are included in its master tag list which is just a huge list of registered tags. Importantly, this table contains deployment dates for when tag finder can should be finding tags. If any tag detections occur outside of these dates they will not be added to the database. If the collaborator has not set a deployment start date, the date of registration is used. If the collaborator has not entered an end date, the deployment start date plus the estimated tag lifespan is used.</p>
<p>This is all in place for a couple of reasons. Tag finder would be impractically slow if it was looking for all possible tags all the time, so we need to give it something more specific to look for by providing it with a list of plausible tags. In addition, Lotek may need to reproduce some tags in the future with the same specifications as other tags that were deployed in previous years so they need to know whether that tag is inactive or not.</p>
<p>We stress that you need to have all tags registered prior to deployment and once they are deployed metadata should be entered as soon as possible. We have included the option of including a default deployment date with your registrations, which can make it less urgent to add in metadata once tags are deployed but does not eliminate this need entirely. This is especially problematic if tags are deployed months after the default deployment date.</p>

<p>In order to retrieve these detections, all receivers that could have those detections must be rerun which can be a long process. At this stage, it is important to enter all of the metadata you can and upload any more tags you may need to have registered. Once this is done, come up with a list of receivers you need to have rerun with the earliest date that you expect to have detections.</p>

<li>It’s a good idea to organize data by tagDeployID, not mfg_ID nor motusTagID. This is because there may be instances where the same tag was deployed on different individuals so the only way to distinguish them is to separate them into different deployments.</li>
